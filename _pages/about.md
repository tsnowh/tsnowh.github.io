I am a second-year MSc student at the University of Toronto with the [Theory Group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/) within the department of Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Mike Molloy](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~molloy/). Previously, I obtained my BMath degree from the University of Waterloo, where I majored in Combinatorics and Optimization and minored in Computational Mathematics. During my time at the University of Waterloo, I completed two Undergraduate Research Assistantship (URA) positions under the supervision of [Prof. Kanstantsin Pashkovich](https://kanstantsinpashkovich.bitbucket.io/index.html) and [Prof. Ricardo Fukasawa](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rfukasaw/).
